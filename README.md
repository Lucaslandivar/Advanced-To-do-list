<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>I make a To-Do List in JavaScript, wich helps the user to organize his tasks into a simple way. I already make a To-do project, but i want to improve it, adding more functions like search a task, edit a task, delete a task and a filter for the tasks.</p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I make this project so i can improve and learn more functions that will be very usefull for me.</p>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
<P>The user can make how many task he want, he have the option to delete the task, edit the task and to complete the task. Also there is search bar so the user can search any task and also a filter to be able to show only the task the user want to see.</p>
